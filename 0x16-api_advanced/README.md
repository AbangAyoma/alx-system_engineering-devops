# API Advanced

## Description

This repository contains solutions for the ALX `0x16-api_advanced` project. The main focus of this project is to practice advanced concepts of interacting with APIs, such as pagination, caching, rate-limiting, and understanding JSON responses.

The repository includes scripts written in Python to perform API queries, handle responses, and demonstrate effective data retrieval from APIs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Work with REST APIs in Python
- Handle pagination and rate limits in API requests
- Manipulate and parse JSON responses
- Manage API credentials securely
- Implement caching to optimize performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pip3
- `requests` module (Install using `pip install requests`)
- API keys and tokens (depending on the service)

## Project Files

- **0-subs.py**: A script that queries the Reddit API to find the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.
- **1-top_ten.py**: Retrieves and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts for a specific subreddit.
- **2-recurse.py**: Recursively retrieves the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit using the Reddit API.
- **100-count.py**: Parses the titles of all hot posts for a given subreddit and prints the count of given keywords.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x16-api_advanced.git
